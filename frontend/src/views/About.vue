      <h1>About CiteLearn</h1>
      <p>CiteLearn is an academic tool for learning to cite sources.</p>
      <p>When university students learn about citation practices, they are effectively being socialised into a particular professional genre with its own institutional contexts and norms (Lea & Street, 2006). A key component of these social norms in academic writing involves a broad set of academic integrity practices of which citation is a key part. But, we often focus on citation only from a plagiarism perspective, rather than their driving purposes for verifiability (McGowan, 2005). Both appropriate paraphrasing, and high quality synthesis writing, are challenging skills to learn but are important for accurate citations and referencing. </p>
      <p>Effective paraphrasing is something all students need support in developing (Keck, 2006) but there are few learning tools to develop citation practices. Previous game based citation tools rely on multiple-choice-quiz (MCQ) assessments largely focusing on issues of plagiarism and academic integrity, and do not directly assess the authentic practices of writing and citing Bradley, 2015).</p>
      <p>The aim of the CiteLearn project is to build  learning tasks for the improvement of information literacy and credibility practices for scalable use across teaching contexts.</p>
