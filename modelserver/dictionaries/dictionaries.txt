To run the models, you will need two dictionaries:
* Sentence dictionary: these are the embeddings for the words in the sentences
* Section dictionary: embeddings for the section titles.

Whatever words or sections are outside these two dictionaries, they will be assigned the UNK embedding. 

The production Dockerfile downloads these files as part of the build process.

For development environments, download the English language dictionaries and place them in this ./dictionaries folder
